# TVSHOWS
Hello People!

As a beginner Web Developer, this is my fourth project ( second one that I am posting on GitHub).

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is a very simple website build with TVMAZE API ( A free API that lets you access TV Shows, Personalities etc )
API Link :-  https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows

I have just built three things
#### No 1.
A Search Bar, from where you can search TV shows around the world
(Please dont expect to get all TV shows in existence :) )

#### No 2.
A schedule page, from where you can search TV shows in any country
for a specific date. For country code, use ISO 31^^-1 codes.
LINKS to country codes :- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1

#### No 3.
A people page, where you can search about people/personalities.
